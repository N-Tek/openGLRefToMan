openGLRefToMan is a group of shell scripts and corrected
manpages used for creating readable manpages that will be 
produced by conversion of DocBook XML sources of official 
OpenGL API references presented by Khronos Group. 

Patches will be created by using helper scripts and manually 
corrected manpages which are presented as a part of the 
sources required for the SlackBuild script.

The user is presented with an option for creation of up-to-date 
SlackBuild source tarball in scripts/CreateSlackBuildSourceTarball.sh
of the source tarball instead of using potentially out-dated 
SlackBuild source tarball. 

After the removal of the package replace the updated 'whatis'
database with it's backup having '.orig' suffix, both located 
under /usr/man/ directory
