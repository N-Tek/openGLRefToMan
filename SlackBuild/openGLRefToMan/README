openGLRefToMan is a group of shell scripts and corrected
manpages used for creating readable manpages that will be 
produced by conversion of DocBook XML sources of official 
OpenGL API references presented by Khronos Group. 

Patches will be created by using helper scripts and manually 
corrected manpages which are presented as a part of the 
sources required for the SlackBuild script
